# 🌌 SyntaX_for_AI
**Pure Power. Absolute Simplicity.**

SyntaX_for_AI is the computational brain of the **SyntaX** ecosystem. It bridges the gap between complex AI architectures and clean, high-performance execution. From Deep Learning to Genetic Algorithms, it offers a unified framework for the modern developer.

---

## ⚡ Core Features
* **Deterministic Models:** 8+ functions for KNN, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes.
* **Neural Stack:** High-density Deep Learning tools powered by TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Evolutionary Logic:** Genetic and Ant Colony Optimization modules.
* **Agent Dynamics:** Built-in multi-agent simulation via Mesa.
* **Rule Engine:** Hard-coded logic gates for human-in-the-loop AI calibration.

## 🛠️ Installation
Ensure you have the required stack installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow sklearn mesa pygad tqdm
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
```python
from better_ai import AI_System_Architect

# Initialize the power
engine = AI_System_Architect()

# Create and Train
brain = engine.build_dnn(shape=10)
engine.master_train(brain, X_train, y_train, type='dl')
```
